# Research Repository: Qubit Dynamics in Anharmonic Baths

Welcome! This repository contains materials related to my research on **open quantum systems with anharmonic environments**. The project explores how environmental vibrations (phonons) affect the coherence and relaxation of quantum systems, with applications in **quantum information processing** and **solid-state physics**.

## Contents

* **Posters** – Research posters presented at conferences.
* **Presentations** – Slides from talks and seminars.
* **Supplementary Information** – Additional figures, notes, and derivations supporting the main results.

## Motivation

Quantum systems are never completely isolated: interactions with their environment cause **decoherence** and **energy loss**, which are central challenges for quantum technologies. While the harmonic environment is well understood, the **anharmonic case**—more realistic for solids—remains less explored at the microscopic level. This work aims to bridge that gap.

## Goals of This Work

* Develop microscopic models for qubits interacting with anharmonic baths.
* Analyze how damping and decoherence depend on temperature and coupling.
* Provide insights for mitigating decoherence in **solid-state qubits**, such as NV centers.

## How to Use This Repository
