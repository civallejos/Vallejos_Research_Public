For the poster, I edited the template at https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/unofficial-poster-template-for-princeton-university/gpbhkmnybpyd. 
The plots were made in Python, most of the figures were made in LaTeX using Tikz (see, for example, the template for Figure 2 at https://tikz.net/molecules_vibrations/), and the others were made in PowerPoint and Mathematica.
