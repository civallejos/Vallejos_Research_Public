**Notes on Figures and Data**

* Poster layout adapted from the [Princeton University LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/unofficial-poster-template-for-princeton-university/gpbhkmnybpyd).
* Figure 1 inspired by the visualization in [“Quantum coherence in solid materials” (2025)](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-quantum-coherence.html).
* All plots and diagrams created in **LaTeX** using *TikZ* and *pgfplots*. For instance, the template for Figure 3 (left) was adapted from [TikZ.net – Molecular vibrations](https://tikz.net/molecules_vibrations/).
and the Bloch sphere was adapated from [stackexchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/618117/blochsphere-package-shading)
* Data for Figure 5 was generated with **Python** (analysis in progress).
